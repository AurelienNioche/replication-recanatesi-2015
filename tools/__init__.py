The docstring for a module should generally list the classes, exceptions
and functions (and any other objects) that are exported by the module,
with a one-line summary of each. (These summaries generally give less
detail than the summary line in the object's docstring.) The docstring
for a package (i.e., the docstring of the package's __init__.py module)
should also list the modules and subpackages exported by the package.
